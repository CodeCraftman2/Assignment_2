# Generics and Collections (Part 1)

This repository contains solutions to programming exercises for the CSW2 (CSE3141) course, Session: Feb 2024 to April 2024, for the CSE&CSIT branch, applicable to all sections.

## Exercise Descriptions:

### Q1. Student Class Creation
- Write a program to create a `Student` class with members `name`, `roll number`, and `age`.
- Design the `Student` class to accept the roll number as either an integer or a string.
- Create a driver class to instantiate `Student` objects and invoke methods.

### Q2. Book Class Creation
- Write a program to create a `Book` class with member variables `bookId`, `bookName`, and `price`.
- Implement necessary methods and constructors.
- Create a driver class to create two `Book` objects and compare them based on their prices.
- Print details of the book objects.

### Q3. Car Class Creation
- Implement a `Car` class with member variables `model`, `color`, and `speed`.
- Add methods and constructors accordingly.
- Develop a driver class to create two `Car` objects, compare them based on speed, and print details of the faster car.
- Overload `compareTo` method of `Comparable` interface.

### Q4. Student Class Search
- Write a program to create a `Student` class with members `name`, `rn`, and `totalMark`.
- Create an array of student objects and perform a linear search to find a specific student object.
- Overload `compareTo` method of `Comparable` interface.

### Q5. Student Class Sorting
- Define a `Student` class with members `name`, `rn`, and `totalMark`.
- Create an array of student objects and sort it using Bubble sort based on `rn`.
- Overload `compareTo` method of `Comparable` interface.

### Q6. Animal Class Creation
- Create an `Animal` class with member variables `name`, `color`, and `types` (pet/wild).
- Override `hashCode` method to print a unique id for the object.
- Instantiate `Animal` objects and print their hashcodes.
